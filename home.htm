<title>Mutillidae: A Deliberately Vulnerable Set Of PHP Scripts That Implement

<p align="center"><b>Mutillidae: A Deliberately Vulnerable Set Of PHP Scripts That 
Implement The OWASP Top 10</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I figure most people 
reading this know, I make infosec tutorial videos for my site
<a href="http://Irongeek.com">Irongeek.com</a>. I wanted to start covering more 
web application pen-testing tools and concepts in some of these videos. Of 
course, I need a vulnerable web app or two to use for these demos. I dig
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project">WebGoat</a>, 
but sometimes it's a little hard to figure out exactly what they want you to do 
to exploit a given web application. Also, WebGoat may be a little too complex to 
use when introducing a web programming newbie to web application security (it's 
easy to get lost in the code, especially J2EE). In an attempt to have something 
to use as a demo in my videos and in class, I started the Mutillidae project.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I'm attempting to do with 
Mutillidae is implement the
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP Top 10</a> 
in PHP, and do it in such a way that it is easy to demonstrate common attacks to 
others. Feel free to use it in your own classes or videos, but if you do I'd 
love to hear about it. Many web app hobbyists and professionals used PHP, and 
it's pretty easy to pick up the basics of the language. The Mutillidae webpage 
is a set of related simple PHP scripts meant to illustrate the core concepts of the
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP Top 10</a> 
vulnerabilities list. For the sake if teaching core concepts, I plan to implement all 
of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, in multiple ways (but I could always use some 
help, especially in writing the hints sections). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the core goals of the Mutillidae project:<br>
<br>
1. Make the code and examples simple to understand so as to get the point across of 
how a given vulnerability works. With 
some of the stuff in Webgoat it is s a little hard to figure how to exploit the 
code, Mutillidae almost exploits itself. My app won't be very realistic, but 
it should illustrate the core concepts well.</p>
<p>2. Be geared in such a way that it's easy to update with new modules and 
hints.</p>
<p>3. Easy to install and run. Just download <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> Lite 
for Windows or Linux, put the scripts in the htdocs directory, and click the 
"Setup/reset the DB" link in the main menu .</p>
<p>4. When folks find bugs in my crappy code, I can legitimately say it's a 
feature. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">
OWASP Top 10</a>&nbsp; page to read about a vulnerability, then choose it from 
the list on the left to try it out. Feel free to play with the code and fix the 
vulnerabilities, it can be very educational. Most of the scripts are vulnerable 
to more than just one of the OWASP Top 10, so I organized them by their OWASP 
names in the menu system.</p>
<p><b>To install: </b>Simply extract the files somewhere in the htdocs folder of
<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> (for example 
htdocs/mutillidae), or run it from your Linux box after installing Apache/PHP/MySQL. 
Also, it should go with out saying that<u> <font color="#FF0000">you should NOT&nbsp; run this code on a production network</font></u>. Either run it on a 
private network, or restrict your web server software to only use the local 
loopback address. You can do that by finding the &quot;Listen&quot; line in the http.conf 
file 
and changing it to read: <font color="#008080">Listen 127.0.0.1:80</font> </p>

just the code, I could also use help in writing the hints sections. Your name
